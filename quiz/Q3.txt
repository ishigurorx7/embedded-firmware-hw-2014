1. What is the _mask value for LED1? 
   What is the address of FIOSET?

1) mask value for LED1
P1_28

Here are the definitions in PinNames.h and LPC17xx.h:

#define LPC_GPIO0_BASE (LPC_GPIO_BASE + 0x00000)

typedef enum {
  // LPC Pin Names
  P0_0 = LPC_GPIO_BASE,
  P0_1, P0_2, P0_3, P0_4, P0_5, P0_6, P0_7, P0_8, P0_9, P0_10, P0_11, P0_12, P0_13, P0_14, P0_15, P0_16, P0_17, P0_18, P0_19, P0_20, P0_21, P0_22, P0_23, P0_24, P0_25, P0_26, P0_27, P0_28, P0_29, P0_30, P0_31, ...

  LED1 = P1_28,
  ...
} PinName

2) FIOSET:
Fast Port Output Set register usng FIOMASK. This register controls he state of output port pins.
Writing 1s produces highs at the corresponding port pins. Writing 0s has no effect.
Reading this register returns the current contents of the port output register.
Only bits enabled by 0 n FIOMASK can be altered.

RegisterName    Address
FIO0SET         0x2009 c018
FIO1SET         0x2009 c038
FIO2SET         0x2009 c058
FIO3SET         0x2009 c078
FIO4SET         0x2009 c098

2. What is the RS232 Frame?

The UART sits between the host computer and the serial channel.
The serial cannel is the collection of wires over which the bits are transmitted.
The output from the UART is a started TTL/CMOS logic level of 0 or 5 volts.
In order to improve bandwidth, remove noise, and increase range, this TTL logic level
is converted to an RS-232 logic level of -12 or +12 volts before beging sent out on the
serial channel.

A frame is a complete and nondivisible packet of bits.
A frame includes both information(e.g., data and characters) and overhead
(e.g., start bit, error checking and stop bits).
In asyncronous serial protocols such as RS-232, the frame consists of one start bit,
seven or eight data bits, parity bits, and stop bit. 
Note that the exact structure of the frame must be agreed upon by both transmitter
and receiver before the common-link must be opened.

The bit time is the basic unitof time used in serial communication.
It is the time between each bit. The transmitter output a bit, 
waits one bit time and then output the next bit. The start bit is used to syncronize
the transmitter and receiver. After the receiver senses the true-false transition
in the start bit, it waits one half bit time and then starts reading the serial line
once every bit time afte that. The baud rate is the total number of bits(information,
overhead, and idle) per time that is transmitted over the serial link. 
So, we can compute the baud rate as the recipocal of the bit time.

3. Explain the start and stop conditions of i2c?

1) Start condition:
The chip issuing the Start condition first pulls the SDA(data) line low,
and next pulls the SCL(clock) line low.

Prior to any transaction on the bus, a START condition needs to be issued on the bus.
The start condition acts as a signal to all connected IC's that something is about to be 
transmitted on the bus. As a result, all connected chips will listen to the bus.

Stop condition:
The Bus Master first releases the SCL and then the SDA line.

After a message has been completed, a STOP condition is sent.
This is the signal for all devices on the bus that the bus is available again (idle).
If a chip was accessed and has received data during the last transaction, 
it will now process this information (if not already processed during the reception 
of the message).

4. Is the i2c acknowledge SDA LOW or SDA HIGH?

LOW. 

The Acknowledge signal is defined as follows: 
the transmitter releases the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse so the receiver 
can pull the SDA line LOW and it remains stable LOW during the HIGH period of this clock 
pulse. Set-up and hold times must also be taken into account.
When SDA remains HIGH during this ninth clock pulse, this is defined as the Not Acknowledge signal.
The master can then gene rate either a STOP condition to abort the
transfer, or a repeated START condition to start a new transfer.

5. Tell me about the DDR3 write leveling Concept in one sentence.  
   (ref: slides)

With DDR3 the memory signals can be allowed to driven to each bank of memory or DIMM
on a fly-by basis.
